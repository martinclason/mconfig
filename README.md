# mconfig: Martins dotfiles

## Installation
Run 'install.sh' and it will automatically create symlinks to the mconfig directory for the following files:
```
~/.config/fish/config.fish -> ./config.fish
~/.config/fish/abbr.fish -> ./abbr.fish
~/.vimrc -> ./.vimrc
~/.emacs.d/init.el -> ./.emacs.d/init.el
```
## Installation on linux systems without fish
Run 'install_linux.sh'. This is dependent on the submodule 'bash-powerline' to work properly. In order to fix this you need to update this submodule by running:
```
git submodule init
git submodule update
```

## Fish
```
brew install fish
sudo echo "/usr/local/bin/fish" >> /etc/shells
chsh -s /usr/local/bin/fish
```

## Oh my fish
```
curl -L https://get.oh-my.fish | fish

```
## bob the fish (powerline theme for fish)
```
omf install bobthefish
```

### Tweaking
```
sudo echo "set -g theme_date_format \"+%H:%M\"" >> ~/.config/fish/config.fish
set -U theme_nerd_fonts no
set -Ux LSCOLORS gxfxbEaEBxxEhEhBaDaCaD
```

## Powerline font
```
brew install homebrew/cask-fonts/font-roboto-mono-for-powerline
```

## NVM
To be able to use nvm with fish this plugin is used: https://github.com/FabioAntunes/fish-nvm.

It wraps regular nvm and will automatically load when running e.g. `node`, `yarn` or `npm`. In order to have it also recognize `react-native`, the fish function `nvm_alias_function react-native` is called.


## tmux
``bash
git clone https://github.com/tmux-plugins/tpm ~/.tmux/plugins/tpm
```

Inside tmux, run <leader>+I to install all plugins using tpm. I have currently mapped <leader> to Ctrl-S.

Using copy paste:

<leader>+[ and then line select with shift-v, copy to system clipboard using y. Dragging mouse also works.
